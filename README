NOTE: 
The directory named "SavedModel19" is supposed to have four files i.e.: an assets directory, a variables directory, a fingerprint.pb file and a saved_model.pb file. Due to size of files admissible for uploading to Github, the assets and variables directories were dropped. If you wish to run the model, you need to fine-tune a version of the model from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/malangalanga/darubini-bert-model) download then replace the SavedModel19 with the new weights. Ensure to rename the directory with the new weights as "SavedModel19".
